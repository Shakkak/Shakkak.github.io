<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Climate change presents a multifaceted challenge, impacting energy systems, urban infrastructure, and financial policies. This panel brings together three papers offering comprehensive insights into the assessment, politics, and policy responses to climate change impacts. Paper 1 examines the effects of climate change on the supply-demand match (SDM) in global wind and solar energy systems. Using state-of-the-art climate models, the paper reveals significant reductions in SDM across various regions by the end of the century, emphasizing the need for early adaptation measures in the energy sector. Paper 2 assesses the effectiveness of current conservation projects and funding allocation in meeting the water needs of the Colorado River Basin, particularly in light of ongoing droughts and climate change. Analyzed 593 projects across thirteen programs, the paper shows that while the majority of funds went to municipal projects, it did not result in high amounts of estimated water savings compared to other categories. Paper 3 studies urban stormwater flooding and policy solutions, focusing on marginalized populations in Chicago. Through socio-institutional network analysis and economic assessments, the paper highlights the importance of coordinated efforts at both local and national levels to address flooding disparities and integrate green infrastructure for sustainable urban development. Paper 4 investigates the carbon emission reduction effect of green financial policies in China. By analyzing data from green finance reform and innovation pilot cities, the paper uncovers significant reductions in carbon emission intensity, particularly through industrial structure optimization and green technology innovation, with regional variations in policy effectiveness. These papers collectively contribute valuable empirical evidence and policy implications for understanding and mitigating the complex impacts of climate change on energy systems, urban resilience, and sustainable finance.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Pumped storage hydropower supports China’s transition to renewable energy by generating electricity when the sun is not shining nor the wind blowing.</p>
<p>A pumped hydro facility pumps water uphill into a reservoir when electricity demand and prices are low, usually at night, then releases it back downhill through turbines to generate electricity when demand and prices are high.</p>
<p>The cost of building pumped hydro is high, but a facility lasts for around 60 years, meaning the full life-cycle cost of its power is relatively low. This reliable method for energy storage has witnessed tremendous growth in recent years, linked to the rolling out of China’s carbon emission goals. Between 2015, the year China adopted the Paris Agreement, and 2023, pumped hydro’s installed capacity more than doubled, from 22.8 gigawatts (GW) to 51 GW.</p>
<p>China wants to increase this to over 62 GW by 2025, and around 120 GW by 2030, according to a plan released by the National Energy Administration (NEA) in 2021. There is currently 167 GW of pumped hydro in planning or under construction.</p>
<p>However, our recent <a href="https://international.lbl.gov/publications/role-pumped-hydro-storage-china-s" class="external" target="_blank">study</a> indicates that simply building more pumped hydro might not be the most cost-effective approach to achieve a zero-carbon power system.</p>
<p>Instead, to ensure grid stability and best support the transition to carbon neutrality, existing pumped hydro systems should be optimised while the more economical option of battery storage is widely deployed.</p>
<section id="pumped-hydro-versus-batteries" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pumped-hydro-versus-batteries">Pumped hydro versus batteries</h2>
<p>China’s solar and wind installed capacity has been increasing dramatically, from 120 GW in 2012 to over 1,200 GW in 2024, NEA figures show. This presents challenges to power system reliability given the variable nature of those energy sources. Technologies like pumped hydro and batteries, which store large amounts of energy, are essential in balancing the grid and increasing the power system’s flexibility.</p>
<p>Though pumped hydro has a longer operational lifespan and a lower cost per kilowatt-hour, battery storage is more suitable for widespread application due to its faster construction time (less than six months) compared to pumped hydro (4-5 years), and the fact it doesn’t need specific topography or water availability.</p>
<p>Pumped hydro is cost-effective and efficient for large-scale, long-duration storage, while batteries offer greater flexibility and quicker response times. The two technologies can therefore play complementary roles. As of the end of 2023, China had 86 GW of energy storage in place, with pumped storage accounting for 59.3% and battery storage 40.6%.</p>
<p>As battery costs have been dropping significantly, there has been a boom in the adoption of battery energy storage, leading to a significant uptick in new projects.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-falling-price-of-batteries-may-leave-pumped-hydro-behind">The falling price of batteries may leave pumped hydro behind</h2>
<p>We wanted to examine the role of pumped hydro in China’s power system and consider its optimum capacity in 2025 to 2050. To do so we used open-source software called GridPath to build a detailed model of China’s electricity system, including hourly provincial loads, interprovincial transmission constraints, regional wind and solar profiles, and cost projections for renewables and energy storage.</p>
<p>Our findings indicate the NEA’s target for 120 GW of pumped hydro by 2030 will be sufficient to balance variable renewable resources. Meanwhile, the cost of batteries, especially those with a four-hour capacity, will continue to decline and be competitive.</p>
<p>The study therefore shows that from 2025 to 2050, battery-storage capacity could skyrocket from 21 GW to 858 GW. This positions battery storage as a more cost-effective approach to managing the variability of renewable-energy sources and meeting increasing energy demands in the longer term.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-path-forward-for-pumped-hydro-in-china">The path forward for pumped hydro in China</h2>
<p>China has set ambitious targets to expand pumped hydro as part of its strategy to transition to a clean power system, introducing various supportive policies. For example, several provinces, such as Inner Mongolia, Beijing, and Shandong, have exempted pumped hydro storage from the water resource tax.</p>
<p>At the central government level, the National Development and Reform Commission last year introduced a fixed payment for pumped hydro operators based on the capacity of their installations. These “capacity payments” are designed to help operators achieve reasonable returns.</p>
<p>Under the current policies and goals in China, optimising pumped hydro projects has become increasingly important. Our analysis produced the following key findings and recommendations that might provide insight as China refines its pumped hydro strategy.</p>
<p>Firstly, pumped hydro development policies and targets should be integrated in the overall planning of China’s electricity system. Currently, energy storage technologies including pumped hydro are not adequately examined in power system planning. Pumped hydro should be compared systematically with other storage options, generation technologies, and transmission solutions to find the appropriate scale and locations. If not, over-built or mismatched pumped hydro projects could increase power system costs and consumer electricity bills.</p>
<p>Re-evaluating pricing is also important. The current pricing mechanism for pumped hydro, set by authorities based on investment costs, needs refinement as it could potentially lead to cost over-run and over-investment in projects, which could then raise electricity prices unnecessarily. Introducing competition through open bidding for pumped hydro projects can help control project costs and keep electricity tariffs lower.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the wholesale electricity market mechanism needs further improvement. Although energy storage is supposedly allowed to participate in the wholesale electricity market, securing profits remains challenging, as the rules are not clear. Reforms could allow the price to be determined by supply and demand, and provide technology-neutral capacity payments, so that energy storage can compete on a level playing field with other technologies.</p>
<p>Lastly, encouraging interprovincial collaborations for pumped hydro projects can enhance the sharing of electricity or storage and improve regional grid stability. Policymakers should work with their counterparts in neighbouring provinces to create a cooperative framework and align regulations. This will support the optimal deployment of pumped hydro and other system resources, resulting in cost savings for consumers.</p>

<p>“Electrifying energy and decarbonizing electricity” lies at the core of global clean energy transition. In this talk, I will first provide an overview of the current global landscape of electrification and power system transitions. I will then focus on China, which hosts the world’s largest power system, to deep dive into the technological, policy, and systemic challenges of achieving carbon neutrality in the power sector. I will also discuss the technological and policy responses designed to address these challenges. The goal is to explore the complexity of clean power transition under climate change, and examine potential pathways to net-zero emissions, and their environmental, climate, human health, and socio-economic implications.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Achieving China’s ambitious long-term climate goals will require fundamental transformations to the power sector. Many techno-economic uncertainties remain which will shape the pace and structure of this trajectory, including the costs of alternative energies, demand growth and electrification, flexibility of conventional generators, and deployment of firm low-carbon resources. In addition, policy evolution in the power sector, including provincial and regional electricity market developments and inter-provincial coordination, will have a large impact on which resources are selected and how they are operated. Open modeling efforts have been engaging with more open-source datasets, which if properly validated could provide a common framework for understanding the key features driving system evolution.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>I have been invited to serve as an external expert in the energy transition sub-working group of the U.S.-China Working Group on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s, which is co-led by Senior Advisor to the President for International Climate Policy John Podesta and China’s Special Envoy for Climate Change Liu Zhenmin and includes relevant officials from the two countries.</p>
<p>As part of this sub-working group, I’ll be collaborating with experts from both the U.S. and China to conduct analysis on ensuring resource adequacy while rapidly integrating low and zero-emission energy sources to aid in the electricity sector transition. We will be meeting periodically to exchange analytical approaches, share preliminary results, and strive to reach a consensus where possible. We will present our findings to the subgroup.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to contributing to this important initiative.</p>

<p>Central to my research ethos is the belief in the power of collaboration to enable transformative change. As the world’s top carbon emitters, China and the U.S. stand at the forefront of the climate challenge. Leveraging my engagement with the Asia Society, I’ve contributed to fostering dialogue to promote cooperation between these two nations, evidenced in a series of reports:</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="background">Background</h2>
<p>As the world’s largest carbon emitter, China has committed to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. The power sector will play a pivotal role in meeting this target. However, due to the uneven distribution of renewable energy resources in China, the mature renewable energy sources, such as solar and onshore wind are located in the western and northwestern regions of China. The eastern coastal regions in China face significant challenges in decarbonizing their energy systems due to the absence of local renewable energy sources and high electricity demand. As electricity demand grows in the future, the gap between their local energy supply and high electricity needs will become more obvious. Rapid development of offshore wind power offers a promising solution to the decarbonization challenge in China’s coastal regions. Furthermore, the cost of offshore wind has decreased rapidly in recent years, making it economically feasible for large-scale deployment.</p>
<p>Berkeley Lab and UC Berkeley conduct a new analysis, “Accelerating offshore wind development enhances energy independence and promotes carbon neutrality in China’s coastal regions.” This study is being conducted by Liqun Peng, Gang He, and Jiang Lin and explores the impacts of offshore wind development on the power generation, transmission networks in China’s power system and more importantly, energy independence of these coastal provinces. The analysis offers insights on what could be done to support offshore wind development to further accelerate power system transition and enhance energy self-sufficiency and economic development in the coastal provinces.</p>
<p>Join this webinar to find out more about our preliminary results, presented by Liqun Peng and Jiang Lin of Berkeley Lab, followed by feedback and comments from a panel of experts moderated by Prof.&nbsp;Gang He of CUNY-Baruch College, Michael O’Boyle from Energy Innovation, Yuan Bo from State Grid Energy Research Institute and Yujing Liu from RMI.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Achieving carbon neutrality requires deploying renewable energy at unprecedented speed and scale, a process that relies on an efficient global clean energy supply chain. However, the pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and climate-driven events, present significant risks to the stability of the global clean energy supply chains. This talk will discuss the changing landscape and evolving debate over global clean energy supply chain, by analyzing the costs implication, carbon savings, air pollution and human health benefits of global clean energy supply chain, using solar PV as an example. In addressing these challenges and maximizing the benefits, there is a pressing need for a commonly agreed framework for a just, resilient, and sustainable clean energy supply chain.</p>

<section id="summary" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>This post is prepared for COP28’s Energy &amp; Industry and Just Transition Day. We propose a multi-faceted framework for a <a href="https://www.climateworks.org/blog/advancing-a-just-resilient-and-sustainable-clean-energy-supply-chain/">just, resilient, and sustainable clean energy supply chain</a> to address the challenges along global clean energy supply chains.</p>
</section>
<section id="challenges" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
<p>Achieving carbon neutrality requires deploying renewable energy at unprecedented speed and scale, a process that relies on an efficient global clean energy supply chain. Based on the IEA’s <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050">Net Zero by 2050</a>, solar and wind energy deployment must reach 20 and 15 times their 2020 levels by 2050, respectively, to bring down global energy-related carbon emissions to net zero. The global supply chains for solar and wind, intertwined with critical minerals and storage technologies, play a pivotal role in the success of this transition.</p>
<p>Today, however, the pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and climate-driven events, present significant risks to the <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/securing-clean-energy-technology-supply-chains">stability of the global clean energy supply chains</a>. The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the vulnerability of global supply chains, disrupting manufacturing, transportation, and distribution networks worldwide. Geopolitical tensions and trade conflicts add another layer of complexity. The trade war has disrupted the free flow of capital, products, and even talents, essential components for the supply chain. Additionally, climate-induced extreme weather events and natural disasters pose physical threats to the infrastructure of the supply chain, affecting both production and distribution.</p>
<p>The unequal distribution of costs and benefits along the supply chain raises ethical and socio-economic concerns, sometimes leading to countries breaking from the supply chain. While some regions benefit economically from the growth of the renewable energy sector, other regions bear disproportionate environmental and social burdens, particularly in Africa, Southeast Asia, and South America. The extraction of <a href="https://www.iea.org/news/iea-summit-on-critical-minerals-and-clean-energy-key-takeaways">critical minerals</a>, essential for battery manufacturing, often occurs in these regions, leading to environmental degradation, exploitation of local communities, and insufficient sharing of economic benefits. Deep seabed mining, promoted by some, presents an added layer of ecosystem risks.</p>
</section>
<section id="benefits" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="benefits">Benefits</h2>
<p>Despite these challenges, the benefits of a global supply chain are massive. An efficient and resilient supply chain is crucial for achieving continued cost reductions in solar, wind, and storage technologies – a key factor to scale up deployment. A paper published in <a href="../../posts/2022-10-nature-cost-savings-of-global-solar-pv-value-chains/index.html"><em>Nature</em></a>, <span class="citation" data-cites="helveston_he_davidson_2022">Helveston, He, and Davidson (2022)</span> show solar PV costs could be 20-30% higher in 2030 if countries move from global supply chain to manufacturing domestically. The interconnectedness of these technologies, facilitated by a global supply chain, not only aids in cost reduction but also plays a pivotal role in carbon mitigation, pollution reduction, and overall improvement of human health. A recent paper published in <a href="../../posts/2023-10-commsee-deploying-solar-pv-first-in-carbon-intensive-regions/index.html"><em>Communications Earth &amp; Environment</em></a>, <span class="citation" data-cites="chen2023deploying">Chen et al. (2023)</span> found that coordination of global solar manufacturing at low carbon regions and prioritize installation at carbon intensive regions could achieve 97.5 Gt more net carbon dioxide mitigation from 2020 to 2060. These benefits underscore the importance of preserving and strengthening the global supply chain, even as we navigate the challenges it presents.</p>
</section>
<section id="a-just-resilient-and-sustainable-framework" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-just-resilient-and-sustainable-framework">A just, resilient, and sustainable framework</h2>
<p>In addressing these challenges and maximizing the benefits, there is a pressing need for a commonly agreed framework for a just, resilient, and sustainable clean energy supply chain. Such a framework would bring together stakeholders from all countries and diverse sectors, fostering understanding and collaboration. This collaborative approach is essential for advancing solutions that continue to harness the benefits of a global supply chain while effectively addressing concerns about the associated risks and uncertainties.</p>
<p>A just, resilient, and sustainable framework for the clean energy supply chain needs to consider the specific challenges faced by different regions, especially in <a href="https://www.seforall.org/our-work/initiatives-projects/renewable-energy-manufacturing-initiative">Africa</a>, <a href="https://www.seforall.org/publications/renewable-energy-manufacturing-opportunities-for-southeast-asia">Southeast Asia</a>, and South America. In these regions, the risks from supply chain disruptions are exacerbated by pre-existing socio-economic vulnerabilities. The pandemic has highlighted the need for robust public health infrastructure, social safety nets, and resilient economic systems. Geopolitical tensions can disproportionately affect developing nations, disrupting their economic development and access to crucial clean technologies. Climate events can have severe consequences in regions that are already overburdened with the impacts of climate change, leading to a compounding of challenges.</p>
</section>
<section id="a-multi-faceted-approach" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-multi-faceted-approach">A multi-faceted approach</h2>
<p>Addressing these challenges requires a multi-faceted approach that combines international cooperation, targeted policy interventions, and technological innovation.</p>
<p>Firstly, international cooperation is essential to facilitate such a clean energy supply chain. Diplomatic efforts should be made to de-escalate trade tensions and foster collaboration between nations. Additionally, a global framework for the ethical and sustainable mining of critical minerals is crucial. This framework should ensure that mineral extraction respects environmental standards, labor conditions, and local communities’ well-being.</p>
<p>Secondly, policy interventions at both national and international levels are vital to create a just, resilient, and sustainable clean energy supply chain. Governments need to implement policies that promote transparency, fairness, and inclusivity in the renewable energy sector. This includes establishing clear guidelines for ethical supply chain practices, incentivizing sustainable mining of critical minerals, and ensuring that the benefits of the renewable energy transition are shared equitably. International organizations can play a pivotal role in facilitating dialogue, setting standards, and providing support for developing nations to strengthen their renewable energy infrastructure and institutions.</p>
<p>Thirdly, technological innovation is key to mitigating risks associated with the clean energy supply chain. Research and development efforts should focus on alternative materials that reduce dependence on critical minerals, recycling technologies to recover valuable components from end-of-life solar panels, wind turbines, and battery packs. Investing in innovative solutions will not only address the current challenges but also future-proof the clean energy supply chain against emerging risks.</p>
<p>In crafting a just, resilient, and sustainable framework, it is crucial to consider the social and environmental impact of the supply chain at every stage. This includes the extraction of raw materials, manufacturing processes, transportation, distribution, installation, operation, and end-of-life disposal. Transparency and standards can ensure accountability and enable consumers, investors, and policymakers to make informed decisions that align with ethical and sustainability considerations.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a just framework should prioritize the empowerment of local communities and workers involved in the clean energy supply chain. This involves fostering skill development, creating job opportunities, and ensuring fair wages and working conditions. Community engagement should be a cornerstone of supply chain and clean energy investments and projects, allowing local residents to actively participate in decision-making processes and share the benefits of renewable energy development.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the global clean energy supply chain stands at a critical intersection of immense benefits and pressing challenges. While it is a linchpin for achieving global climate goals, its vulnerabilities to disruptions, geopolitical tensions, and unequal distribution of costs and benefits cannot be ignored. Creating a just, resilient, and sustainable framework for the clean energy supply chain is not only an ethical imperative but also a pragmatic necessity. By doing so, we can ensure that the benefits of renewable energy are realized globally, leaving no one behind in the clean energy transition to achieve climate goals.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>China’s power sector in 2022 accounted for about 1/4 of global coal consumption, 1/8 of global energy related carbon emission, and at the same time, 40% of global solar and wind capaicity. This fast transiting sector is under pressure to lower its carbon emissions while strive to power the world’s largest manufacturer and fastest growing mid-class. The scale and scope of China’s clean power transition is unprecedented and its impacts are enormouse, yet its trojactories are uncertain. How can China’s power sector achieve carbon netrality will in large impact how can the world meet the net-zero goals. Modeling China’s power transition is both important and challenging. After years’ efforts, and collaboration, I decide to open-source SWITCH-China Model and make it SWITCH-China Open Model to facilitate the modeling integration and comparison, data sharing, policy discussion and debate.</p>

<p>The Production Gap Report tracks the misalignment between governments’ planned and projected production of coal, oil, and gas and the global production levels consistent with the Paris Agreement’s temperature goal. Now, in its fourth edition, this year’s report features two major updates to the production gap analysis, drawing on changes in government plans and projections since August 2021 and the new mitigation scenarios database compiled for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Sixth Assessment Report. The report provides a more detailed assessment of the global coal, oil, and gas reduction pathways needed to keep the 1.5°C goal in reach.</p>
<p>The report also features individual country profiles for 20 major fossil-fuel-producing countries, evaluating governments’ latest climate ambitions and their plans, policies, and strategies that support fossil fuel production or the transition away from it: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Germany, India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Mexico, Nigeria, Norway, Qatar, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, the United Arab Emirates, the United States of America, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>This report is produced by the Stockholm Environment Institute(SEI), Climate Analytics, E3G, the International Institute for Sustainable Development(IISD), and the UN Environment Programme(UNEP).</p>

<p>Governments, in aggregate, still plan to produce more than double the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. The persistence of the global production gap puts a well-managed and equitable energy transition at risk.</p>
<p>Global levels of coal, oil , and gas estimated under the government plans and projections pathways would be 460%, 29%, and 82% higher than those under the respective 1.5°C-consistent pathways. The global levels of fossil fuel production implied by governments’ plans and projections, taken together, also exceed those implied by their stated climate mitigation policies and implied by their announced climate pledges as of September 2022, as modelled by the International Energy Agency.</p>
<p>Given risks and uncertainties of CCS and CDR, countries should aim for a near total phase-out of coal production and use by 2040 and a combined reduction in oil and gas production and use by three-quarters by 2050 from 2020 levels, at a minimum. The potential failure of these measures to become sufficiently viable at scale, the non-climatic near-term harms of fossil fuels, and other lines of evidence, call for an even more rapid global phase-out of all fossil fuels.</p>

<p>The global surge in solar photovoltaic (PV) power has featured spatial specialization from manufacturing to installation along its industrial chain. Yet how to improve PV climate benefits are under-investigated. Here we explore the evolution of net greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation of PV industry from 2009–2060 with a spatialized-dynamic life-cycle-analysis. Results suggest a net GHG mitigation of 1.29 Gt CO2-equivalent from 2009–2019, achieved by 1.97 Gt of mitigation from installation minus 0.68 Gt of emissions from manufacturing. The highest net GHG mitigation among future manufacturing-installation-scenarios to meet 40% global power demand in 2060 is as high as 204.7 Gt from 2020–2060, featuring manufacturing concentrated in Europe and North America and prioritized PV installations in carbon-intensive nations. This represents 97.5 Gt more net mitigation than the worst-case scenario, equivalent to 1.9 times 2020 global GHG emissions. The results call for strategic international coordination of PV industrial chain to increase GHG net mitigation.</p>

<p>We welcome Assistant Professor Gang He to the Marxe School and discuss his research, experiences, recent projects, two courses he will be teaching, and more.</p>
<h3 id="welcome-joining-the-marxe-school.-could-you-tell-us-more-about-your-research" class="anchored">Welcome joining the Marxe School. Could you tell us more about your research?</h3>
<p>My research focuses on using data-driven, evidence-based analysis to inform energy and climate policy, I call it DEEP policy research. My overall research goal is to enable a rapid, sustainable, resilient, and just energy transition to achieve carbon neutrality and address climate challenges. I have been developing my research on deep decarbonization pathways of the electric power sector, role and impacts of global clean energy supply chains, energy systems adaptation to climate change, and justice implications of energy transition. My work has been published in high-impact journals such as <em>Nature</em>, <em>Nature Communications</em>, <em>One Earth</em>, <em>Environmental Science and Technology</em>. Engaging in the policymaking process is crucial to me, as it allows for real-world impact. I have had the opportunity to testify for the New York State Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, offering insights before it become law. Additionally, I have advised the New York State Climate Action Council’s Scoping Plan. I’m excited to join the Marxe School and be surrounded by such a dynamic, diverse, and dedicated community of scholars and students. I’m eager to collaborate and contribute to the policy analysis, research, discussions, and debates aimed at fostering a better climate and society.</p>
<h3 id="what-drew-you-to-climate-change-policy" class="anchored">What drew you to climate change policy?</h3>
<p>As a first-generation college student and academic in my family, my journey began unexpectedly. When I was accepted into Peking University to study geography, I was working on a construction site. It was during my studies that I discovered my passion for geography, as it trained me to develop a systematic understanding of the big picture and allowed me to explore various places, people, and cultures through my fieldwork. During a project in southwest China, I observed firsthand the consequences of climate change. Due to increased rainfall and deforestation, the thin layer of topsoil is literally eroding from under the feet of local mountain residents, and with it their livelihoods. One event shaped my career trajectory significantly. After participating in the UN Climate Change Conference COP 11 in Montreal in 2005 as a youth delegate, I became increasingly involved in climate protection. I worked with fellow students and founded the first student climate club at Peking University, raising climate awareness among students and promoting environmental initiatives on campus. This experience propelled me to pursue a master’s degree in Climate and Society at Columbia University, followed by research work in the Program on Energy and Sustainable Development at Stanford University and a Ph.D.&nbsp;on Energy and Resources from the University of California, Berkeley. Over my lifetime, I have witnessed global annual carbon emissions double in forty years, reaching about 37 billion tons in 2021. Urgent actions are needed to reduce carbon emissions to net-zero by mid-century. I firmly believe that evidence-based policy can incentivize, leverage, and cultivate the necessary changes to achieve carbon neutrality.</p>
<h3 id="can-you-share-more-about-your-ongoing-research-project-on-clean-energy-supply-chain" class="anchored">Can you share more about your ongoing research project on clean energy supply chain?</h3>
<p>Achieving carbon neutrality requires deploying renewable energy at unprecedented speed and scale, yet countries sometimes implement decoupling policies that might impede continuous cost declining. International climate policy and renewable energy deployment policy now face a crossroads: continue relying on global supply chains, or pivot towards domestic technology development and production. In a collaborative paper published in Nature, our research team found globalized supply chain has saved solar installers in the United States, Germany, and China $67 Billion from 2008 to 2020, and solar prices would be 20-30% higher in 2030 if countries move to produce domestically. Build on the findings of the Nature paper, we are studying the carbon mitigation, air quality, and human health benefits of global solar PV supply chains, with support from the Global Energy Initiative at ClimateWorks Foundation. In addition, we are actively exploring opportunities and collaboration to address the challenges and implications to enable a sustainable, resilient, and just global clean energy supply chain to achieve climate goals.</p>
<h3 id="what-will-you-be-teaching-in-the-fall" class="anchored">What will you be teaching in the Fall?</h3>
<p>The urgent challenge of climate change demands innovative solutions and comprehensive policy frameworks. In the Fall 2023 semester, I will be teaching two courses focused on energy and climate change policy. The undergraduate course, “Energy, Climate, and Society”, takes a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach to understanding the science behind climate change, the complex technological and policy considerations, and the necessary pathways to transition towards a carbon-neutral future. The graduate-level course, “Energy and Climate Policy”, adopts a systems approach to delve into the essential policy questions and analytic tools necessary to achieve the energy transition required to address climate change. In both classes, we aim to inspire and equip students, especially those from underrepresented groups and underserved communities, to pursue careers in the energy and climate field. We strive to empower them with the knowledge and skills needed to make a positive impact on climate solutions.</p>

<p>Battery storage is critical for integrating variable renewable generation, yet how the location, scale, and timing of storage deployment affect system costs and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is uncertain. We improve a power system model, SWITCH-China, to examine three nationally uniform battery deployment strategies (Renewable-connected, Grid-connected, and Demand-side) and a heterogeneous battery deployment strategy where each province is allowed to utilize any of the three battery strategies. Here, we find that the heterogeneous strategy always provides the lowest system costs among all four strategies, where provinces with abundant renewable resources dominantly adopt Renewable-connected batteries while those with limited renewables dominantly adopt Demand-side batteries. However, which strategy achieves the lowest CO2 emissions depends on carbon prices. The Renewable-connected strategy achieves the lowest CO2 emissions when carbon prices are relatively low, and the heterogeneous strategy results in the lowest CO2 emissions only at extremely high carbon prices.</p>

<p>Water scarcity and climate change are dual challenges that could potentially threaten energy security. Yet, integrated water–carbon management frameworks coupling diverse water- and carbon-mitigation technologies at high spatial heterogeneity are largely underdeveloped. Here we build a global unit-level framework to investigate the CO2 emission and energy penalty due to the deployment of dry cooling—a critical water mitigation strategy—together with alternative water sourcing and carbon capture and storage under climate scenarios. We find that CO2 emission and energy penalty for dry cooling units are location and climate specific (for example, 1–15% of power output), often demonstrating notably faster efficiency losses than rising temperature, especially under the high climate change scenario. Despite energy and CO2 penalties associated with alternative water treatment and carbon capture and storage utilization, increasing wastewater and brine water accessibility provide potential alternatives to dry cooling for water scarcity alleviation, whereas CO2 storage can help to mitigate dry cooling-associated CO2 emission tradeoffs when alternative water supply is insufficient. By demonstrating an integrative planning framework, our study highlights the importance of integrated power sector planning under interconnected dual water–carbon challenges.</p>
