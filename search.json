This panel brings together three papers offering comprehensive insights into the assessment, politics, and policy responses to climate change impacts. Paper 1 examines the effects of climate change on the supply-demand match (SDM) in global wind and solar energy systems. Using state-of-the-art climate models, the paper reveals significant reductions in SDM across various regions by the end of the century, emphasizing the need for early adaptation measures in the energy sector. Paper 2 assesses the effectiveness of current conservation projects and funding allocation in meeting the water needs of the Colorado River Basin, particularly in light of ongoing droughts and climate change. Analyzed 593 projects across thirteen programs, the paper shows that while the majority of funds went to municipal projects, it did not result in high amounts of estimated water savings compared to other categories. Paper 3 studies urban stormwater flooding and policy solutions, focusing on marginalized populations in Chicago. Through socio-institutional network analysis and economic assessments, the paper highlights the importance of coordinated efforts at both local and national levels to address flooding disparities and integrate green infrastructure for sustainable urban development. Paper 4 investigates the carbon emission reduction effect of green financial policies in China. By analyzing data from green finance reform and innovation pilot cities, the paper uncovers significant reductions in carbon emission intensity, particularly through industrial structure optimization and green technology innovation, with regional variations in policy effectiveness. These papers collectively contribute valuable empirical evidence and policy implications for understanding and mitigating the complex impacts of climate change on energy systems, urban resilience, and sustainable finance.\nOrganizer: Gang He, CUNY-Baruch College\nPanel Chair: Gang He, CUNY-Baruch College\nDiscussant:\nMallory Flowers, University of Rhode Island\nEmre Hatipoglu, KAPSARC School of Public Policy\nPresentations\nID# 52932 Climate Change Impacts on Planned Supply–Demand Match in Global Wind and Solar Energy Systems\nLaibao Liu1, Gang He2, Mengxi Wu3, Gang Liu4, Haoran Zhang5, Ying Chen6, Jiashu Shen4 and Shuangcheng Li4, (1)The University of Hong Kong, (2)CUNY-Baruch College, (3)The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, (4)Peking University, (5)University College London, (6)University of Birmingham\nID# 54815 Addressing Water Scarcity in the Colorado River Basin: Review of Conservation Policies\nPaloma Avila, Mehdi Nemati, Daniel Crespo and Ariel Dinar, (1)University of California, Riverside\nID# 52935 Urban Stormwater Flooding: Policy Solutions Addressing Chicago’s Marginalized Sub-Populations\nDarren Christoper, Caleb Hadley, Ron Henderson, Hao Huang, David Lampert, Michael Sansone, Matthew A.

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe clean development mechanism (CDM) has been a leading international carbon market and a driving force for sustainable development. But the eruption of controversy over offsets from Chinese wind power in 2009 exposed cracks at the core of how carbon credits are verified in the developing economies. The Chinese wind controversy therefore has direct implications for the design and negotiation of any successor to the Kyoto Protocol or future market-based carbon regimes. In order for carbon markets to avoid controversy and function effectively, the lessons from the Chinese wind controversy should be used to implement key reforms in current and future carbon policy design. The paper examines the application of additionality in the Chinese wind power market and draws implications for the design of effective global carbon offset policy. It demonstrates the causes of the wind power controversy, highlights underlying structural flaws, in how additionality is applied in China, the Offsetters’ Paradox, and charts a reform path that can strengthen the credibility of global carbon markets.\n\n\n\nThe Offsetters’ Paradox: if credits are given for the difference between BAU1 and target trajectories, any domestic policy that lowers baseline emissions to create BAU2 reduces carbon payments, and therefore disincentivizes domestic emissions-reducing policies that would shift BAU1 to BAU2."
