I'm happpy to provide recommendation letters if you were **in my class** or **collaborated directly with me**. If you do not meet those requrements, then I probably do not know you good enough to write you a letter. 

Please send bullet points answering the following questions:

- What (class) project were you working on?
- What have you done (contribution) for the project?
- What challenges did you have when working on the project?
- How did you manage the challenges?
- Summarize why you are interested in the opportunity/position.

Please share the opportunity/position links and deadlines. Please reach out to me at least **one month** before deadline. If you need me to submit the letter to multiple schools/positions, please try to send the submission links all at once.
