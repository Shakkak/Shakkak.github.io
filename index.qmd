:::{#hero-heading}

I am M. Shakib Hosseinzadeh, currently pursuing my master's degree in computer science at the Polytechnic University of Tehran.
 My research focuses on self-supervised learning in images, particularly in histopathology.
  I aim to advance methodologies that leverage self-supervised learning to enhance image analysis and interpretation
   in the medical field. Through my work, I seek to bridge the gap between machine learning and healthcare,
    offering innovative solutions to improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in histopathological assessments.
